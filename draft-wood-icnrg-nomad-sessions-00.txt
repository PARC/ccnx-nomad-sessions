                       Nomad Sessions with CCNxKE
                   draft-wood-icnrg-nomad-sessions-00

Abstract

   Traditional IP-based transport security protocols function between
   two peers.  Sessions are bound to both peer's addresses.  Whenever
   either end host address changes, such as when one changes network
   interfaces or moves between access points, the session must be re-
   established to associate it with the new address tuple.  The base
   CCNxKE protocol allows a producer to migrate a session to trusted
   endpoints during the key establishment phase.  In this document, we
   describe an extension to this protocol that enables this type of
   producer-side session migration during normal usage of the session.
   Furthermore, in instances where the session is used for bidirectional
   traffic, we describe an extension that allows consumers to signal the
   producer when their routable prefix changes.  Together, this allows
   for nomad consumer-to-producer (or service) sessions in CCN, i.e.,
   sessions that are not pinned to prefixes or machines.

1.  Introduction

   CCNxKE is a protocol that enables a consumer and producer to create a
   session in a namespace, e.g., /nameA, over which they can communicate
   securely.  An example of this session is shown below.

   +----------+          /nameA           +----------+
   | Consumer +----(encrypted channel)----> Producer |
   +----------+                           +----------+

   The standard CCNx protocol allows the producer to migrate this
   session from one namespace (prefix) to another.  For example, if the
   producer is mobile and its prefix changes from /nameA to /nameB, then
   the producer indicates this migration through a MoveToken provided to
   the consumer.

   +----------+          /nameB           +----------+
   | Consumer +----(encrypted channel)----> Producer |
   +----------+                           +----------+

   In uni-directional sessions where the consumer only sends interests
   to the producer, the consumer is free to change prefixes at will.
   However, in bi-directional sessions, the consumer must notify the
   producer of its prefix change retroactively to migrate the session
   information as needed.

   The remainder of this document describes the signaling protocol used
   to perform these prefix migrations and enable nomad sessions.

2.  Prefix Migration

   A CCNxKE peer must only perform prefix migration if it is receiving
   interests from another peer in a session.  Prefix migration may be
   proactive or reactive.  In the former case, the migrating party
   provides a (MoveToken, MovePrefix, MoveTag) tuple to the peer by
   sending an interest carrying this information.  In the latter case,
   this tuple is provided as a response to an interest.  In both cases,
   the tuple is carried in the CCNxKE signaling fields of the respective
   interest or content object.

   To generate the (MoveToken, MovePrefix, MoveTag), the migrating peer
   performs the following computations.

   MoveTokenCT, MoveTokenTag = AEnc(K, H(H(client_migration_token)) + TS)
   MoveToken = K_id +  MoveTokenCT +  MoveTag

   where K_id is the key identifier for the key K and + is
   concatenation.  Here, the client_migration_token value is the _source
   proof_ and treated as the migration token for the migrating peer.
   (It may therefore be producer_migration_token if the producer is
   migrating).  Also, AEnc is shorthand for authenticated encryption
   that produces a ciphertext and authentication tag.  One such
   algorithm is AES-GCM [GCM].

   Once the peer receives a MoveToken it MUST use the newly provided
   MovePrefix for future messages.  To complete the migration, the
   stationary peer must echo the source proof, e.g.,
   H(client_migration_token), along with the (MoveToken, MoveTag) tuple
   to the migrating peer.  The migrating peer then confirms correct
   receipt of the token by performing the following steps:

   1.  If K_id is not valid, i.e., the migrating peer has no key with
       that identifier, then the session is not updated.

   2.  Otherwise, the migrating peer computes

       MoveTokenCT, MoveTokenTag = MoveToken
       token_hash + TS = ADec(K, MoveTokenCT, MoveTokenTag)

   If the decryption fails, i.e., if the encryption is not valid (the
   ciphertext was tampered with), then the Interest is dropped.  3.
   Otherwise, the migrating peer computes H(Proof) and compares it to
   H(H(client_migration_token)) in the plaintext.  If these values are

   equal, then the migrating peer supplies a new Session ID to the
   stationary peer and also sends a key-update message to cycle the TS.

2.1.  Examples

   The following exchange shows a producer retroactively migrating from
   the prefix /nameA to /nameB.  The producer communicates the migration
   information in content object responses sent to the consumer.

   Consumer (stationary)              Producer (migrating)
      |   /nameA, (normal interest)       |
      +---------------------------------->|   (interest)
      |                                   |
      |  (MoveToken,/nameB,MoveTag)       |
      |<----------------------------------+   (content)
      |                                   |
      | /nameB, (MoveToken,MoveTag,Proof) |
      +---------------------------------->|   (interest)
      |                                   |
      |  (SessionID)                      |
      |<----------------------------------+   (content)

   The following exchange shows a consumer proactively migrating from
   the prefix /prefixA to /prefixB.  The consumer sends migration
   information in interests to the producer.

   Consumer (migrating)                      Producer (stationary)
      |  /prefixA, (normal interest)             |
      |<-----------------------------------------+
      |  (normal data response)                  |
      +----------------------------------------->|
      |                                          |
      |  /nameA, (MoveToken,/prefixB,MoveTag)    |
      +----------------------------------------->|   (interest)
      |                                          |
      |  (ACK data response)                     |
      |<-----------------------------------------+   (content)
      |                                          |
      | /prefixA, (MoveToken,MoveTag,Proof)      |
      <------------------------------------------+   (interest)
      |                                          |
      |  (SessionID)                             |
      +------------------------------------------>   (content)

   In the case where the producer has a prefix for the consumer (in a
   bidirectional session), the producer may send the migration
   information in an interest according to the flow above.
